7,not verified  i recently had a very disappointing experience with air arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy i booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra  just to make the ticket cancellable later due to unavoidable reasons i had to cancel the ticket instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method air arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering i had paid extra for a cancellable ticket when i tried to use these credits for my own flight booking i was shocked to find out that i couldnt use them because the credit was under my brothers name despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account this makes no senseif air arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points then at the very least they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account regardless of the passengers name this is a highly restrictive and unfair policy if an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings regardless of passenger name as long as it is within the same account this experience has left me with a very negative impression of air arabias policies instead of offering customerfriendly solutions they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers i would strongly advise anyone considering air arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a cancellable ticketbecause in reality your money might not be as flexible as you think i certainly wont be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customerfriendly very disappointed with their refund  credit policies,False,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,1,1,no,2,3,2,2025,January,air_arabia

22,trip verified    weeks after a complaint and no response from the airline which would only mean they condone with this conduct or even train their staff to act accordingly i checked into flight g the experience was pleasant and smooth i reported at the gate well ahead of time and waited while enjoying a cup of coffee and a slice of cake boarding time approached and passed by with not so much of a murmur as to why there was a slight delay this did not cause any problem as the aircraft was in sight and nothing seemed amiss finally boarding started and there seemed to be a plan in place as passengers were requested to board according to their seat rows i felt the girl at the gate was checking this and it did not bother me as i comfortably awaited my turn which turned out to be the last call the wait on the sky bridge seemed unusually long and when i got to the door i waited till the purser fruitlessly tried to tell a couple that they would do their best to sit them together do we all not know that it is a budget airline and we pay for our seats if we have requirements did the purser not know how to handle this more quickly without delaying the aircraft further at my seat i found the bins full this is when a male cabin crew managed to humiliate and accuse me he directed me to move to the back of the cabin and place my bag there to which i refused i had paid to bring in my bag and if they had no control of passengers at the back putting bags in front for convenience it was not my problem his next comment was that if i wanted to put my bag in front i should have boarded first i did tell him that it was their boarding procedure that hindered me from alighting the plane earlier to which he said well other people came on he directly pointed out that it was my fault and would not stop accusing me i do not buy a ticket on an airline to be humiliated by an attendant i did find a spot a few seats in front of me and placed it there was that so difficult to show me that without pretending to be an authority and creating some onboard entertainment he would be the reason i would never travel air arabia again,True,Business,Economy Class,3,3,2,no,1,1,1,2023,December,air_arabia

332,trip verified   moscow to marrakech via casablanca i must say that this airline is very nice and i have no hesitations using it in the future online service is a bit weird because it is literally impossible to select your seats properly the system selects them for you and there seems to be no logic behind the selection moscow to casablanca  hours  minutes ontime checkin was a breeze the flight was operated by a b with a nice modern interior and mood lighting and we were randomly assigned emergency exit seats  which has tons of legroom and very comfortable oldfashioned thick seat profile pillows and blankets were waiting on every seat  a rare sight the flight was halfempty so there was lots of room to spread out for everyone the staff were polite and quite friendly but it took them almost an hour and a half to start the service  which is awfully long for a daytime flight the meals  full trays with salads desserts bread and a hot main dish  were delicious especially the preordered seafood meal even if the presentation was a bit lacking they also had complimentary moroccan wine in small glass bottles which was very classy as well as great in taste surprisingly they served one more meal around an hour before landing which consisted of two large sandwiches for each passenger this is the first time i felt so full after the economy class flight and thats a very rare thing nowadays the plane had no personal entertainment or power ports so consider bringing your own marrakechcasablanca  minutes ontime checkin was very fast once again but surprisingly not even the airport employee could not change the assigned seats since she apparently did not have access to the system and i have been assigned a seat in different row that of my travel companion the flight on an atr was almost empty with only  passengers and the atr was the most comfortable plane of its category i ever took a lot of legroom once again this flight features zero service not even drinks which i found surprising  they could have at least provided water not a big deal considering its just a short hop casablanca airport is not a great place for transit but not the worst one ive been to rome fiumicino im looking at you long lines and a sense of chaos everywhere but the waiting times were actually very small casablancamoscow  hours  minutes the flight to moscow was operated by a similar b and was jampacked with transit passengers from nigeria and the boarding was extremely chaotic and disorganized with the staff checking almost everyone for explosives right before boarding once onboard i tried to ask a flight attendant for a seat change but he told us to wait until after takeoff i asked another one and this time the attendant was extremely nice and helpful and even arranged for me to reseat in another regular economy row to me more comfortable then we switched seats with some fellow passengers that have also been separated by the weird royal air maroc seat assignment system and ended up in the bulkhead row the service was similar to the first flight but this time they even provided amenity kits  with eye masks and socks and the quality of the kit itself was better than that of singapore airlines for example the food and wine were great again and the luggage arrived safely,True,Family Leisure,Economy Class,5,4,5,yes,4,5,1,2017,December,royal_air_maroc

809,trip verified   we were able to fit everything into carry on luggage which was helpful especially outbound on the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control check the bags then get back into the passport line this was frustrating but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didnt actually have a problem in addition the employees marshaling the passport lines were very headsup and were moving people to fill gaps in the line they also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon including those in english we were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to jfk but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged all of this means we were very fortunate since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didnt have to deal with af ground service which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than ok either  the in flight experience was fine although af is one airline where it pays to fly premium economy we flew regular economy because of the size of our group and the service was less cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service much more attentive the further forward you go which is not a very passengercentric strategy the aircraft wasnt new but had been refreshed ife worked and had lots of options outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time return flight was on time in premium economy or business class air france an excellent airline but in economy its a little disappointing af could learn a lot from delta which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin or even from united which is mediocre front to back most of my international travel is to france and most of that is on air france this is unlikely to change still i live in hope that air france ups its game on the service front,True,Family Leisure,Economy Class,3,2,4,yes,3,3,1,2022,July,air_france

883,trip verified   first mediumhaul experience with air france this is part of a connecting flight from lhrmia via cdg checkin at lhr was swift thanks to sky priority customers flying premium economy get sky priority access due to covid checkin meant extra checks and formalities during checkin all my documents were verified in less than  minutes i received my onward boarding pass to mia this is my first mediumhaul trip with air france the equipment used on this flight was a  year old boeing er i was among the first passengers to board this full and busy flight the cabin crew upon boarding were very friendly and warm the plane was in an immaculate condition and was kept very clean we left  minutes behind schedule due to technicalities and the crew gave regular updates after take off the crew sprung into action they distributed a sanitary kit which consisted of a mask alcohol surface wipes and hand sanitiser we were told that unfortunately amenity kits were not loaded on this flight and the crew were very apologetic the meal service was swift but was done with care lunch served was good in quality but lacking in quantity which is the only downside the crew were also very proactive with the drinks service after the main meal service cabin lights were switched off and were invited to help ourselves to the selfhelp snack bar which was adequately stocked with drinks and snacks the second meal service came in a rather chic paper bag which consisted of a warm sandwich a bread roll a muffin a chocolate bar orange juice and a yoghurt drink in addition drinks were served again for a  hour flight the quality of the meals served was good but lacking in quantity air france could perhaps increase their portions when it comes to premium economy dining the seat on this aircraft is air frances fixed shell seat which mean that rather than reclining the seat slides forwards so that it does not intrude your personal space the seat was wide with good cushion padding the pillow and blanket also appeared to be off higher quality compared to other airlines ive flown with in premium economy the seat also came with a leg rest which was a very good addition now there are a lot of negative reviews of this product but i would say that this seat is adequately comfortable for a transatlantic flight my back did get a little sore from the seat sliding forward but i used the pillow to add some padding i requested for an extra pillow and was given one without hesitancy as we were flying during covid cabin crew and passenger interaction was very minimal to keep each other safe however i noted that the crew were very responsive in meeting the needs of the passengers from what i observed ife content was outstanding there were more than enough new holywood films available and a couple of french western asian and bollywood films in addition the ife offering also had plenty of radio stations and album selections in addition the plan is equipped with an external camera air france is nowhere near a perfect carrier as there are things that air france could do better in terms of its premium economy service which in my opinion would be increasing portion sizes of meals and offering a bar service as only red wine was offered during the drinks service overall air france is a great alternative to fly across the atlantic,True,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,3,5,4,yes,4,3,5,2021,November,air_france

1258,trip verified  tel aviv to stockholm via paris cdg i arrived at the airport well in advance and since i only had cabin baggage i could proceed directly to security which is a big advantage at ben gurion where there is often a long line at check in i had tried to order a gluten free meal for the flight but i realized i could not do that since the meal at the first flight was considered breakfast where there is no option of gluten free and on the second flight they only serve what they call a snack so there is no option there either so there goes one of the reasons not to choose a low cost carrier instead buying a cheap ticket at air france you dont get any check in luggage anyway so the difference compared to low cost airlines is minimal well you get some kind of meal if you manage to eat it and some coffee for free but the worst part is the seating comfort i have recently flown with low cost carriers like ryanair and norwegian and both of these have had more leg room than air france i am not very tall so if you are a bit taller than  m you will probably have to pay extra to get a better seat at this airline they also make people pay in order not to have to choose between the last available seats  hours before departure the airplane was decent enough but since most passengers dont want to pay extra for baggage there was lots and lots of cabin luggage and the staff were a bit too aggressive when trying to stow it away also one of the toilets on one of the flights did not have tap water it would have been better if that was marked on the door so i am sorry to say that air france tends to get worse and worse for every time the only reason to choose air france is if you can manage to get enough time in paris to go into town otherwise you can just as well choose ryanair,True,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,4,3,no,2,2,1,2017,November,air_france
