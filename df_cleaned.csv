1,not verified  i recently had a very disappointing experience with air arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy i booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra  just to make the ticket cancellable later due to unavoidable reasons i had to cancel the ticket instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method air arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering i had paid extra for a cancellable ticket when i tried to use these credits for my own flight booking i was shocked to find out that i couldnt use them because the credit was under my brothers name despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account this makes no senseif air arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points then at the very least they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account regardless of the passengers name this is a highly restrictive and unfair policy if an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings regardless of passenger name as long as it is within the same account this experience has left me with a very negative impression of air arabias policies instead of offering customerfriendly solutions they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers i would strongly advise anyone considering air arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a cancellable ticketbecause in reality your money might not be as flexible as you think i certainly wont be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customerfriendly very disappointed with their refund  credit policies,highly restrictive and unfair policy,0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi,2,2,3,1,1,0,2,2025,January
