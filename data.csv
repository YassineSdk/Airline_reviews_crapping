1,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think! I certainly won’t be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customer-friendly.

I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket.

When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

91,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket.

This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

181,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

231,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think! I certainly won’t be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customer-friendly.

271,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

361,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

491,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think! I certainly won’t be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customer-friendly.

I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket.

If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

581,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket.

This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

671,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

721,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think! I certainly won’t be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customer-friendly.

761,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

851,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

941,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think!

981,"Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think! I certainly won’t be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customer-friendly.
